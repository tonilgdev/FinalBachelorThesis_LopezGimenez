ABSTRACT
> The aim of this project is to carry out a study of variations in human peripheral temperature as affected by stress, sleep and/or physical activity. To do this we have divided the project into two parts: the development of the measurement system and the assessment of this end. In order to be able to carry out the assessment correctly, we need to develop a system that can obtain the peripheral temperature of the subject to be studied and also know if it has been affected by physical activity. For this purpose we have developed a measurement system with a temperature sensor and an accelerometer as well as an RTC to be able to know at what instant of time the data have been collected. Finally, the assessment consists of the test subject taking the system with him/her for 2-3 days and returning it to download the data for analysis.
